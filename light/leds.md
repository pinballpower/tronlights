## Aluminium houses 3-color LEDs

![](led_aluminium_enclosure.jpg)

RGB LED, common anode, rated 3W, tested up to about 2.5W per color

Continuous power of about 2W for 30minutes+ working well.

### U/I characteristics

|Current|R|G|B|
|---|---|---|---|
|200mA|2.5V|3.1V|3.3V|
|300mA|2.7V|3.3V|3.6V|
|400mA|3.0V|3.5V|3.8V|
|500mA|3.2V|3.7V|4.1V|
|600mA|3.5V|3.9V|4.4V|

Running on a single color at 600mA, the device heats up to 65Â°C, which is still unproblematic. However, as the additional luminosity is minimal, it's probably best to drive these with about 400mA per color.
